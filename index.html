            <h3>mission for webdeveloper</h3>
            <p>I am a college student soon to be graduating, and at present to keep myself afloat I am a web-developer (backend and a bit of frontend) utilizing frameworks like Laravel, PHP, etc.
    
            S I find developing a project and coding extremely rewarding. However, I am a bit worried about the type of lifestyle that accompanies development (and programming in general I suppose). </p>
